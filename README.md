# TimeSync

TimeSync is an android application that I am currently working on. The primary goal of the application is allow an 
individuals to improve their "work" efficiency by providing them concise data about their daily time expenditure. 
It works by allowing a user to measure the amount of time they are spending on certain activities throughout the day.
The application then stores this data to allow a user to see how their daily time usage changes over time.
A user will have the option to change the default activities listed in the application so they can personalize the
application. Furthermore, a user can change the priority of each activity which allows the application to predict 
methods by which they can adapt their lifestyle to improve their "work" efficiency.
